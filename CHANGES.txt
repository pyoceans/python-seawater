What's new in this version of seawater
======================================

19 April 2006  release 3.2
--------------------------
Corrected sign of potential vorticity in `bfrq`.

24 November 2005  release 3.1
-----------------------------
Added `swvel` to compute surface wave velocity.

12 December 2003  release 3.0
-----------------------------
Converted code so that temperature is now ITS-90 throughout.

25 June 1999  release 2.0.2
---------------------------
Coding changes to enable functions to return the same shape vector as
the input arguments.  In previous releases, some functions returned
column vectors for row vector input.  Also some other tidying up.

22 April 1998  release 2.0.1
----------------------------
`satAr`    New routine.  Solubility of Ar in seawater
`satN2`    New routine.  Solubility of N2 in seawater
`satO2`    New routine.  Solubility of O2 in seawater
`test`     Updated to include tests for above

April 1998  release 1.2e
------------------------
`alpha`    Fixed bug where temp used in calculations regardless of the keyword.

15 November 1994 release 1.2d
-----------------------------
`bfrq`   Now also returns potential vorticity.  Thanks to Greg Johnson
         (gjohnson@pmel.noaa.gov)

`gvel`   OMEGA=7.29e-5 changed to OMEGA=7.292e-5 to be consistent with `f`

IMPORTANT API CHANGE: The usage of `alpha`, `beta` and `aonb` routines has
changed!  All these routines expect (S,T,P) to be passed instead of (S,PTMP,P)
as in previous releases of seawater.  Fast execution can still be obtained by
passing ptmp=True see help.

19 October 1994 release 1.2c
----------------------------
`bfrq`   Fixed bug where LAT = [] was needed as argument when no latitude
         values are being passed.  Now pass PRESSURE instead of DEPTH ->
         more consistent though only a negligible change is answers.

12 October 1994 release 1.2b
----------------------------
First official release and announcement on the networks.
