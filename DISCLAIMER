     (including  consequential  financial  loss or  damage) of
     the Licencee, its  officers, agents and  employees or  any
     third party  howsoever caused,  which may  be suffered  or
     incurred  or which  may  arise directly  or  indirectly in
     respect of  or  arising  out  of  the  Licencee's  use  or
     inability to use  the Software or the failure or  omission
     on the  part of CSIRO  to comply  with the conditions  and
     warranties under  this  Licence  Agreement.    Insofar  as

3.5  The  Licencee's  obligation to  indemnify  CSIRO  and  its
     officers,  employees  and  agents set  out  in  clause 3.4
     hereof   is   a   continuing   obligation   separate  from
     and independent of the Licencee's other obligations  under
     this  Agreement,  and  shall  survive  all  expiration  or
     termination of this Agreement.

4.0 Termination

4.1  The Licence shall terminate  immediately upon the Licencee
     breaching any term or  condition of this Agreement whether
     or  not CSIRO is aware of  the occurrence of the breach at

SW_INFO    Computational routines for the properties of sea water

SEAWATER - developed by Phil Morgan, CSIRO

DESCRIPTION:
   SEAWATER is a toolkit of MATLAB routines for calculating the
   properties of sea water. They are a self contained library and
   are extremely easy to use and will run on all computers that
   support MATLAB.

What's new in this version of seawater
(copied from matlab version for tracking purpose)

19 April 2006  release 3.2 (For version 5.x and onwards of Matlab)
********************************************************
Corrected sign of potential vorticity in sw_bfrq.

24 November 2005  release 3.1 (For version 5.x and onwards of Matlab)
********************************************************
Added sw_swvel to compute surface wave velocity.

12 December 2003  release 3.0 (For version 5.x and onwards of Matlab)
********************************************************
Coverted code so that temperature is now ITS-90 throughout.

25 June 1999  release 2.0.2 (For version 5.x of Matlab)
********************************************************
Coding changes to enable functions to return the same shape vector as
the input arguments.  In previous releases, some functions returned
column vectors for row vector input.  Also some other tidying up.

22 April 1998  release 2.0.1 (For version 5.x of Matlab)
********************************************************
This version is not optimised but will run under Matlab 5.x
sw_satAr    New routine. Solubility of Ar in seawater
sw_satN2    New routine. Solubility of N2 in seawater
sw_satO2    New routine. Solubility of O2 in seawater
sw_test     Updated to include tests for above

April 1998  release 1.2e (For version 4.x of Matlab)
************************
sw_alpha    Fixed bug where temp used in calculations regardless of
            whether 'temp' or 'pmpt' was passed as keyword.

sw_info     Shorter version. Refer users to web pages
            http://www.marine.csiro.au

sw_ver      New routine. Returns version number of SEAWATER

sw_test     New Routine. Run a test on the SEAWATER routines
            and compare results with literature values

94/11/15 release 1.2d
**********************
sw_bfrq.m   Now also returns potential vorticity.
            Thanks to Greg Johnson (gjohnson@pmel.noaa.gov)

sw_gvel.m   OMEGA=7.29e-5 changed to OMEGA=7.292e-5 to be
            consistent with sw_f.m

            IMPORTANT CHANGE: The usage of the following
            routines has changed!

sw_alpha.m |    All these routines expect (S,T,P) to
sw_beta.m  |--  be passed instead of (S,PTMP,P) as in
sw_aonb.m  |    previous releases of seawater.
                Fast execution can still be obtained by passing
                ptmp with a string flag 'ptmp' see help.

94/10/19 release 1.2c
**********************
Added routine sw_new.m to inform of updates and new features.
sw_bfrq.m   Fixed bug where LAT = [] was needed as argument when
            no latitude values are being passed.
            Now pass PRESSURE instead of DEPTH -> more consistent
            though only a negligible change is answers.

sw_info.m   Updated to include a registration section.
            Noted that software is FREE.
            Noted best email address is seawater@ml.csiro.au
            Requests for Report also via email to library@ml.csiro.au

94/10/12 release 1.2b
********************
First official release and announcement on the networks.
